## Overview

A very basic recipe to install snappy from a downloaded tarball.

NOTE: **Not needed for HBase / Flume / Hadoop** (those should use the native libs as provided by the hadoop_cluster cookbook)

From [their documentation](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/):

> Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
> compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it
> aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared
> to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most
> inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100%
> bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy
> compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or
> more.  Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable and
> MapReduce to our internal RPC systems. (Snappy has previously been referred to
> as "Zippy" in some presentations and the likes.)
>
> For more information, please see the README. Benchmarks against a few other
> compression libraries (zlib, LZO, LZF, FastLZ, and QuickLZ) are included in
> the source code distribution. The source code also contains a formal format
> specification, as well as a specification for a framing format useful for
> higher-level framing and encapsulation of Snappy data, e.g. for transporting
> Snappy-compressed data across HTTP in a streaming fashion. Note that there is
> currently no known code implementing the latter.
>
> Snappy is written in C++, but C bindings are included, and several bindings to
> other languages are maintained by third parties
